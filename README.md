# Claiming Azure Passes

In case you don't have proper paid Azure subscription, you will be provided *Azure Passes* by the lab instructor.

To claim Azure Pass
-------------------
In order to use Azure Passes, you are required to have a personal *Microsoft Account*, you *can't* use the passes with your *company account*. If you don't have a Microsoft Account you should create one now with e.g. your Hotmail or Gmail email address etc.

1. Log *out* from all Microsoft services with your browser. To do this you can go for example to: https://account.microsoft.com/account and log out.
2. Use your *private* Microsoft account on this page to claim the Azure Pass and to create a *new* Azure subscription: https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/
3. Login to https://portal.azure.com with the same private account and go to *Subcsriptions*, you will see the Azure Pass subscription. Available credits will show *zero*, this is expected and normal.
4. Ready to go!

When you have Azure Subscription
--------------------------------

Only proceed when you are sure the subscription works.
